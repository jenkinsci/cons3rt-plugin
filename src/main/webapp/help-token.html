The ReST api token for this CONS3RT site. Tokens should be provided as secret-text based Jenkins credentials. 
More information about api tokens and how to get yours can be found <a href="https://cons3rt.reamaze.com/kb/accounts/api-tokens">here</a>
<p>Note: If the token provided is a user credential-store based credential (User: Example User) other users may be prevented from modifying the job configuration (because they will only be able to see their own credentials).</p>
